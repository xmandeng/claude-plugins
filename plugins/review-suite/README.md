# review-suite

A Claude Code plugin bundling five slash commands for interactive review and diagramming workflows. Generated playgrounds render in a browser and deliver structured feedback back into the live Claude Code session that authored them, via a shared devserver with a WebSocket PTY bridge.

## Slash Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/plan-review [<ticket>]` | Section-by-section HTML review playground for an implementation plan. Approve / flag-for-revision / ask-questions per section, then click "Send to Claude" to deliver the feedback bundle. |
| `/design-review [<ticket>]` | Interactive before/after component diagram. Per-node approve/revise/question controls, saved named layouts, per-node comment pins. |
| `/architecture-map [<ticket>]` | Concept-map playground for an existing application. Draggable node graph with layered filters, per-node insights, per-node feedback pins. Seeded from chat context. |
| `/code-diagram [<scope>]` | Graphviz `.dot` source plus rendered SVG/PNG/PDF for call graphs, class models, dependency graphs, and component/process diagrams. Optional scope argument narrows the slice of code being diagrammed. |
| `/devserver [port]` | Starts (or reuses) the devserver from the project root, so you can browse generated playground HTML files without first invoking a review skill. |

```

### Devserver

`bin/devserver.py` is a `SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` plus:

- **PUT `/*-layouts.json`** — atomic write, scoped to spawn cwd, 256 KB cap, path-traversal-safe. Used by design-review / architecture-map templates to persist named layouts.
- **WS `/api/claude?session=<sid>`** — bridges browser `xterm.js` to a local `claude --resume <sid> --fork-session` PTY. Each generated playground embeds the authoring session id at generation time; the fork inherits the full conversation context that authored the doc but runs as an independent working session. The hand-off model is intentional: it lets the playground work from background-agent (`bg`) sessions, which refuse re-attach. Set `REVIEW_SUITE_NO_FORK=1` to disable forking and use attach-mode (foreground sessions only).

Default port: `8765`. Override with `REVIEW_SUITE_PORT`. Override LAN IP with `REVIEW_SUITE_HOST`.

### Hook

A single `UserPromptSubmit` hook injects the current session id into every turn as `review-suite-session-id: <sid>`. The three playground-generating skills (`/plan-review`, `/design-review`, `/architecture-map`) grep for this label to bake the sid into the generated HTML's `CLAUDE_SESSION` constant, so the "Send to Claude" button can resume the exact authoring session. `/code-diagram` and `/devserver` don't use the hook (no PTY bridge needed).

### Port reuse

The first invocation of any skill that starts the devserver (`/plan-review`, `/design-review`, `/architecture-map`, or `/devserver` directly) picks the first free port in 8765-8799 and writes it to `<project>/.plan-review/.devserver-port`. Subsequent invocations in the same project reuse that port. Concurrent projects auto-allocate sequential ports.

## Tests

```
python3 -m pytest plugins/review-suite/tests/ -v
```

54 tests cover the pure-logic surface of the devserver: WebSocket framing (RFC 6455), LAN-IP resolution, log filtering, the `resolve_safe_layouts_target` PUT-path validator, and the `DevHandler.do_PUT` end-to-end happy path and rejection cases (403/413/415/400). PTY/fork paths and the live HTTP server are integration concerns and aren't exercised in the unit suite.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `claude` CLI in PATH (for the PTY bridge)
- `jq` (for the session-id hook)
- `graphviz` / `dot` (only for `/code-diagram`)
- `ptyprocess` (optional — devserver falls back to stdlib `pty.fork()` if missing)
